# About me
Here are a few things about me...

Name: Andrew

Pronouns: he/him

Program: MSPPM

Three fun facts: 
- I was at PNC Park for the Pirates game when Albert Pujols hit his 703rd home run, the last home run of his career.
- I am a huge sports fan and enjoy playing most sports. My favorite teams to root for are the Chicago Bears, Chicago White Sox, and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. 
- I am interested in education policy and community and economic development. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn many things about data viz in this class. I hope to learn how to design data visualizations that always have the end user in mind. I also hope to learn transferable data viz design methods that can be used with any data viz tool. I also hope to learn ways to quickly identify if a data visualization I see is doing well in terms of design execution and contextual awareness. Basically, I hope to have the skills needed to quickly identify if a data visualization (found anywhere) is good or not. 
After I graduate, I will be moving to Arlington, VA to start as a full-time Analyst with Deloitte's Government & Public Services practice.

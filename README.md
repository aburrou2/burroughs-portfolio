# About me
Here are a few things about me...

Name: Andrew

Pronouns: he/him

Program: MSPPM

Hey everyone! Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Andrew and I am a second year MSPPM student. It is truly bittersweet to be in my last semester of graduate school! I am originally from the suburbs of Chicago and consider myself a proud Midwesterner. In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, going to breweries, and sometimes if I am feeling bold enough, I will go to a brewery AND watch sports. I also enjoy running and closely follow professional track and field. I have spent time working/interning in the education and government (state, city, and federal) spaces and aspire to make an impact in communities through more equitable, data-driven decision making. 

This is my sixth year living in Pittsburgh as I attended the University of Pittsburgh for my Bachelor's degree. Here are five things on my Pittsburgh bucket list that I want to check off before graduation: 
1. Run up Canton Avenue, the steepest public street in America.
2. Eat CMU dining hall food. 
3. Go to a CMU basketball game.
4. Attend a CMU School of Music performance. 
5. Get a slice of pizza at Beto's Pizza. 

Three fun facts about me: 
- I was at PNC Park for the Pirates game when Albert Pujols hit his 703rd home run, the last home run of his career.
- I am a huge sports fan and enjoy playing most sports. My favorite teams to root for are the Chicago Bears, Chicago White Sox, and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. 
- I am interested in education policy and community and economic development. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn many things about data viz in this class. I hope to learn how to design data visualizations that always have the end user in mind. I also hope to learn transferable data viz design methods that can be used with any data viz tool. I also hope to learn ways to quickly identify if a data visualization I see is doing well in terms of design execution and contextual awareness. Basically, I hope to have the skills needed to quickly identify if a data visualization (found anywhere) is good or not. 

After I graduate, I will be moving to Arlington, VA to work as a full-time Analyst with Deloitte's Government & Public Services practice.

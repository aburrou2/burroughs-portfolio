# Wireframes / storyboards

Building off my sketches from last week, I chose to build out my story in Shorthand. My wireframe can be found [here.](https://preview.shorthand.com/iF7Uqf4d2WbXOTbP) The Shorthand link to a project storyboard represents a rough draft of my final presentation. The wireframes of my data visualizations use real program data and the storyboard element builds off what I had in my sketches for Part 1. The storyboard incorporates my Flourish-created data visualizations and additional visualizations created in Canva.

This process was not a simple creation of exactly what I had in my sketches from last week. Each visualization is quite different (and more accurate) than what was presented in the sketches last week. Additionally, the text elements have more thought and meaning behind their words than last week. There is still room for growth in all areas, but the storyboard creation process was intentional. The hope is that I have more finetuning than large scale changes to make going into next week. The user interviews will be critical in determining that. 

I chose to build this out in Shorthand because I feel like the sketches I had in Part 1 were high enough fidelity that the next logical step was to actually create them and implement them into a storyboard. As this is my first time using Shorthand, I do anticipate many recommendations on how to enhance my storytelling. As it relates to my storyboard, color is an important element. The color theme of dark or light is supposed to correspond with the information and emotions related to that information. The theme is white for the initial information of WIC participation and impacts on health outcomes. The theme changes to dark when I talk about negative aspects of the story (e.g. that WIC funding is tied to participation and overall participation is trending downwards). It stays dark when I talk about how many eligible participants are not participating and then turns back to a light color (to represent hopefulness) that talking about three lesser-known elements of the program can increase participation. 


I created four, not two, slope charts. This is the biggest change from my sketches. The differences in participation were so large among the most popular categories (children and postpartum women) among both women and children participants that some categories were cut-off in the image. I think this worked out well as among both women and children participating, participation decreases among non-breastfeeding participants and increases among breastfeeding participants. I decided to break out the slope charts by breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding participants (for both women and children) and they both clearly show where participation is decreasing and increasing. Overall participation is down, but not in each individual category. There is variance with the labels of each slope chart. The slope charts for the women have their labels on the side of each starting point, while the slope charts for children have their labels on the slope lines. This is because putting them on the side for the children would cut off the bottom label. Putting them on the line for the women would make it awkward to read since the bottom line in the breastfeeding slope chart is angled upward and a user would likely need to turn their head to read the label. I played around with Flourish and there was no way to have one method (on the line or on the side) work for all four slope charts. I think this works and is not confusing since they (i.e. children and women participation) are presented separately and consistently (i.e. children slope charts have on line labels and women slope charts have side labels). 

Lastly, the images used in the storyboard are supposed to correspond to the story at the time. I implemented pictures of children or children and their parents on several occasions. The Canva created pictures are simple, but effective. They may be too simple, however, and I am eager to learn what people think about those images in user interviews. 


# User research 

## Target audience
I have two target audiences that I hope to reach with my story. The first is residents of Southwestern Pennsylvania, particularly people who know local mothers, infants, and/or children or may become a parent in the area in the future. My story focuses on an issue relevant to the area. That should make it easier for me to present it to the class as each person in the class lives in the area and likely knows local mothers, infants, and/or children. Speaking to an audience that has a genuine reason to care about the issue should be helpful. This issue is not limited to the area though, and the second audience I have is broader. The second audience is policymakers who have a broader and more general reason to care about the issue. 

It should be easy to identify residents in the area that know local mothers, infants, and children or may become a mother in the area. I will identify people I know to speak with, and I will not interview people I do not know. I recognize that I could potentially get better feedback from people I do not know well, but given the time constraints it makes the most sense to interview people I know that are in the target audience. 

Finding people in the second audience (policymakers) will be more difficult. I will instead target people that have a broader and more general reason to care about the issue. I understand that targeting actual policymakers would give me the best feedback, but that is difficult given the time constraints. I will try and target people with a good, broad understanding of data visualization and storytelling instead. I think people in that category could give me important feedback on how to target my story to policymakers who can enact change because of my story.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Determine the emotions that the story evokes|How did this story make you feel (and at what points did you feel certain feelings)? What do you think made you feel how you felt?|
|Identify key takeaways from the story|What are your key takeaways from that story?|
|Determine how effective colors were|What did you think of the color scheme in the story? Where could it be improved? What was unclear or confusing about the colors?|
|Determine if information was presented logically (i.e. how did the story unfold)|What do you think about the order the information was presented in? Did it make sense?|
|Determine effectiveness of data visualizations|What did you think of the data visualizations? Could you understand them?|
|Determine effectiveness of images|What did you think of the images? Could you understand them and were they not distracting?|
|Determine effectiveness of text|What did you think of the text in the storyboard? Was there enough, too little or too much text? How did the text complement the graphics and images?|

The goal of user interviews is to get objective feedback on my storyboard. I will present it as a work in progress that can benefit from honest and open feedback from people in my intended audience. I will start the interview by thanking the interviewee for their time and telling them that I am taking notes of what they say and that I will not record any PII. I will also explain to them that this project is part of my Telling Stories with Data final project and that the interview should only take around 10 â€“ 15 minutes. After these introductions, I will allow the interviewee to scroll through the storyboard. I will not interrupt them while they do this. After they go through the storyboard, I will then begin asking the questions found above. I will be sure to take verbatim notes and ask follow-up questions. After I am done with my questions, I will thank the interviewee and then synthesize my notes. 

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

My first interview was with a male in their 20s who does data visualizing and storytelling as a part of his job. He was the person I interviewed to represent a broad, policymaker audience. 

My second interview was with a female in their 20s. They are part of the first intended audience, a resident of Southwestern Pennsylvania who knows mothers, infants, and children and may also become a mother in the area.

# Wireframes / storyboards

Building off my sketches from last week, I chose to build out my story in Shorthand. My wireframe can be found [here.](https://preview.shorthand.com/iF7Uqf4d2WbXOTbP) The Shorthand link to a project storyboard represents a rough draft of my final presentation. The wireframes of my data visualizations use real program data and the storyboard element builds off what I had in my sketches for Part 1. The storyboard incorporates my Flourish-created data visualizations and additional visualizations created in Canva.

This process was not a simple creation of exactly what I had in my sketches from last week. Each visualization is quite different (and more accurate) than what was presented in the sketches last week. Additionally, the text elements have more thought and meaning behind their words than last week. There is still room for growth in all areas, but the storyboard creation process was intentional. The hope is that I have more finetuning than large scale changes to make going into next week. The user interviews will be critical in determining that. 

I chose to build this out in Shorthand because I feel like the sketches I had in Part 1 were high enough fidelity that the next logical step was to actually create them and implement them into a storyboard. As this is my first time using Shorthand, I do anticipate many recommendations on how to enhance my storytelling. As it relates to my storyboard, color is an important element. The color theme of dark or light is supposed to correspond with the information and emotions related to that information. The theme is white for the initial information of WIC participation and impacts on health outcomes. The theme changes to dark when I talk about negative aspects of the story (e.g. that WIC funding is tied to participation and overall participation is trending downwards). It stays dark when I talk about how many eligible participants are not participating and then turns back to a light color (to represent hopefulness) that talking about three lesser-known elements of the program can increase participation. 


I created four, not two, slope charts. This is the biggest change from my sketches. The differences in participation were so large among the most popular categories (children and postpartum women) among both women and children participants that some categories were cut-off in the image. I think this worked out well as among both women and children participating, participation decreases among non-breastfeeding participants and increases among breastfeeding participants. I decided to break out the slope charts by breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding participants (for both women and children) and they both clearly show where participation is decreasing and increasing. Overall participation is down, but not in each individual category. There is variance with the labels of each slope chart. The slope charts for the women have their labels on the side of each starting point, while the slope charts for children have their labels on the slope lines. This is because putting them on the side for the children would cut off the bottom label. Putting them on the line for the women would make it awkward to read since the bottom line in the breastfeeding slope chart is angled upward and a user would likely need to turn their head to read the label. I played around with Flourish and there was no way to have one method (on the line or on the side) work for all four slope charts. I think this works and is not confusing since they (i.e. children and women participation) are presented separately and consistently (i.e. children slope charts have on line labels and women slope charts have side labels). 

Lastly, the images used in the storyboard are supposed to correspond to the story at the time. I implemented pictures of children or children and their parents on several occasions. The Canva created pictures are simple, but effective. They may be too simple, however, and I am eager to learn what people think about those images in user interviews. 


# User research 

## Target audience
I have two target audiences that I hope to reach with my story. The first is residents of Southwestern Pennsylvania, particularly people who know local mothers, infants, and/or children or may become a parent in the area in the future. My story focuses on an issue relevant to the area. That should make it easier for me to present it to the class as each person in the class lives in the area and likely knows local mothers, infants, and/or children. Speaking to an audience that has a genuine reason to care about the issue should be helpful. This issue is not limited to the area though, and the second audience I have is broader. The second audience is policymakers who have a broader and more general reason to care about the issue. 

It should be easy to identify residents in the area that know local mothers, infants, and children or may become a mother in the area. I will identify people I know to speak with, and I will not interview people I do not know. I recognize that I could potentially get better feedback from people I do not know well, but given the time constraints it makes the most sense to interview people I know that are in the target audience. 

Finding people in the second audience (policymakers) will be more difficult. I will instead target people that have a broader and more general reason to care about the issue. I understand that targeting actual policymakers would give me the best feedback, but that is difficult given the time constraints. I will try and target people with a good, broad understanding of data visualization and storytelling instead. I think people in that category could give me important feedback on how to target my story to policymakers who can enact change because of my story. 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Determine the emotions that the story evokes|How did this story make you feel (and at what points did you feel certain feelings)? What do you think made you feel how you felt?|
|Identify key takeaways from the story|What are your key takeaways from that story?|
|Determine how effective colors were|What did you think of the color scheme in the story? Where could it be improved? What was unclear or confusing about the colors?|
|Determine if information was presented logically (i.e. how did the story unfold)|What do you think about the order the information was presented in? Did it make sense?|
|Determine effectiveness of data visualizations|What did you think of the data visualizations? Could you understand them?|
|Determine effectiveness of images|What did you think of the images? Could you understand them and were they not distracting?|
|Determine effectiveness of text|What did you think of the text in the storyboard? Was there enough, too little or too much text? How did the text complement the graphics and images?|

The goal of user interviews is to get objective feedback on my storyboard. I will present it as a work in progress that can benefit from honest and open feedback from people in my intended audience. I will start the interview by thanking the interviewee for their time and telling them that I am taking notes of what they say and that I will not record any PII. I will also explain to them that this project is part of my Telling Stories with Data final project and that the interview should only take around 10 – 15 minutes. After these introductions, I will allow the interviewee to scroll through the storyboard. I will not interrupt them while they do this. After they go through the storyboard, I will then begin asking the questions found above. I will be sure to take verbatim notes and ask follow-up questions. After I am done with my questions, I will thank the interviewee and then synthesize my notes. 

## Interview findings
My first interview was with a male in their 20s who does data visualizing and storytelling as a part of his job. He was the person I interviewed to represent a broad, policymaker audience. 

My second interview was with a female in their 20s. They are part of the first intended audience, a resident of Southwestern Pennsylvania who knows mothers, infants, and children and may also become a mother in the area. 

My third interview was with a female in their 50s. They have lived in Southwestern Pennsylvania their whole life and have been in the home daycare business of 0 - 6 year olds for 17 years. 

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How did this story make you feel?|"A little informative or interested. A little confusion at the beginning, because it jumps to straight health outcomes instead of discussing problem statement or other stuff."|"I feel informed. I’m not happy or sad about it, just feel overall more informed by it."|"I was surprised that the participation is going down."|
|What do you think made you feel how you felt?|Mentioned the flow of information and said the storyline seemed choppy. "Not as fluid or as grabbing as it could be." He also mentioned that the amount of white space contributed to his feelings.|"The story. Scrolling through it with more facts as I go, helped me learn."|"I felt surprised when I saw the graphics."|
|What are your key takeaways from that story?|That participation was decreasing. He said he did not pickup that funding was a key message at all.|"WIC supports women, infants, and children, in basic every day needs." "I think that is my main takeaway. What it is and what it's for."|“I would think that there are plenty of people out there who should be using it that are not. I can’t believe that it’s not needed. But then again, people don’t know what they can do. I feel like with WIC people know how to get help with it or start. But I guess not.”|
|What did you think of the color scheme in the story?/Where could it be improved? What was unclear or confusing about the colors?|He mentioned that the green arrows were confusing and unclear. He suggested I use different colors for the arrows.|"I did like the color scheme, I did think it was appealing The flow and the design of the website was easy to follow." As it pertains to improvements she said "In the beginning, I think there is too much white space."|She mentioned that the color scheme was good and said that they were not confusing. The colors were "bright enough, clear, and easy to see."|
|Is the shift from light to distracting?|"A little bit, there is a lot of color space as opposed to wording."|"I like the switch to black, but less white space before it changes."|"I mean it’s certainly noticeable but I didn’t think about it."|
|What do you think about the order the information was presented in? Did it make sense?|"Uh I like having what is WIC early and say what is going on and then define what I see. More problem first, then health outcomes. Or show bad participation and then good with getting more participation. Misconceptions at the end. Tie audience at the beginning to what is going on now and how it might relate to them and then explain why its bad and why it needs to improve."|"The flow makes a lot of sense and is easy to understand what its about and who its for."| She mentioned that the participation decline among children and women that are breasfeeding was confusing. She suggested presenting the breastfeeding mothers and children together and then presenting the non-breastfeeding groups together. "It was captivating at the beginning."|
|What did you think of the data visualizations? Could you understand them?|He liked the bar graphs and the percents. He also said he remembered the trends and not the numbers. He said that red is just as good as a downward trend so maybe that could be incorporated somewhere and that percent change could be better to show than the "true delta."|"Yeah I really like the red dots and the graphs were pretty and easy to understand."|She could understand them but mentioned that she was confused by the categories in the bar chart, especially about the breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding groups. She also mentioned the categories were helpful but more context around them would be more helpful.|
|What did you think of the images? Could you understand them and were they not distracting?|“Thought they were good, definitely don’t need to take those out.”|“I liked them. Not distracting.”|She said they were good and not distracting and were easy to understand.|
|What did you think of the text in the storyboard? Was there enough, too little or too much text? How did the text complement the graphics and images?|"I think it is pretty good." Amount of text is good, but they said the spacing is off. They also mentioned it would be easier to comprehend if it was more concise with better flow.|Enough text. “Neither one overpowered the other, which was good”|"Perfect, concise. Easy to read"|

### Additional Thoughts/Findings from Interviews

The first interviewee mentioned that spacing, the order of the storyboard, and that emphasizing funding and any numerical things or total takeaways would be the most important things to focus on in the next iteration. He also emphasized that connecting the audience right away is crucial. It was also clear in talking to him that I should clarify the abbreviations (WIC and SW) so the audience understands them. He also said that the only thing that seemed bad about the program was that there was less participation. He also emphasized that I should lead with the Whys and try and use numbers to captivate the audience. The first interview provided many crucial insights, but I should have followed up more on some of his comments.

The third interviewee took awhile to go through the storyboard and asked many clarification questions. She brought up important points about the program that I will need to address as important context for the program. It will be important to keep her questions in mind as I change the text in the storyboard and develop my presentation. 

## Feedback from Class

The in-class exercise will also inform the changes I make. Because of that, it is important to include that feedback here as well. During the in-class exercise, the group mentioned that the context about the program and what WIC stands for was helpful. THey mentioned that the context is important to have since the audience in class has many international students. They suggested I reconsider how I present the graphics, particularly the slope charts. They suggested that I either present them next to each other instead of vertically, or that I break out the groups differently and put them into two charts (instead of four). They also said that the graphic which uses red dots was confusing because of the color scheme. It was hard to tell what the colors referred to since both used red (and the same color scheme). They suggested using a saturation instead of the same red, or completely different colors. Lastly, one member mentioned that I should include a case study in my call to action to point to an example of where the three areas increased participation.

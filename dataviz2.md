# Visualizing Government Debt

## Image 1: A Web-Based Data Visualization

The image below is a web-based image from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. The image contains all OECD countries reporting their Debt-to-GDP ratio in the most recent reporting year. All countries are the same color because the intention is for no country to stick out. An additional purpose of making each bar the same color is to allow the viewer to make any comparisons they want to. The graphic in its current state does not emphasize any comparisons aside from comparing any country or countries to the OECD average. One more note on the clarity of this graphic. The ascending left-right sort makes the contrast between the countries with the lowest and highest debt-to-GDP ratios clear.

## Image 2: Flourish Grid of Line Charts

Below is a graphic from the Tool Flourish that uses the same data as  Image 1. The time period for this graphic spans from 1995 - 2021. Data for each country is presented when available and not every country is shown for the entire time period. The image below looks at time completely differently than Image 1. One key observation with the image below is that Debt-to-GDP ratio varies throughout the world. It is not just countries on one continent that have high (or low) Debt-to-GDP ratios. There is a lot going on in this graphic which is why the title is simple. The varying ratios are the most apparent initial observation. Because of this, I made them the focus of the title. Drawing attention to specific countries or regions would require too much thinking/searching for a viewer. 

The default color for this graphic was blue. I thought that was too 'cool' of a color and did not match the topic. Debt-to-GDP ratios are not an inherently cool or neutral idea and can be quite bad for world governments. Because of this, I wanted to choose a more neutral color that is not associated with coolness. I initially used purple, but decided on yellow since yellow is a neutral color between red and green. Some Debt-to-GDP ratios could be depicted with red (if they are bad) and green (if they are good) but since this graphic shows all the ratios together, a neutral color like yellow makes sense based on its neutral connotation. 

Another idea I went back and forth on for awhile was if I should include grid lines. I took them out, but I thought that taking them out would make it too difficult for the viewer to make comparisons or look at individual countries. The gridlines seem to point a viewer in the direction of where the comparison time period begins and ends for a country and at what ratio value it begins at as well. 

I did not include axis labels in this graphic because I think it is obvious what they mean. Adding them would contribute clutter to the graphic in a format like this. I also think that the title, which references the Debt-to-GDP ratios and time period, emphasizes that the axes will refer to ratio and time information. I also made sure that the country abbreviations aligned with the Y-axis. I initially changed the country abbreviations to be centered. However, alignment is important and contributes to clarity so I changed them to be left-aligned. 

Two things I wish I could have done differntly, but could not figure out how to do on Flourish pertain to both axes. I would have liked to change the Y-axis (the Debt-to-GDP ratio value) to have a more incrementally even scale. I think an increment of 50 or even 100 would have been suffice. Both would be less confusing than what is currently presented. As for the X-axis, I wish that the year labels started at the first year in the data set (1995) and ended with the last year (2021). These changes would enhance the clarity of the time period in the graphic. The title does indicate a longer comparison period than is shown in the X-axis, but the title and axis label should have better agreement.

## Image 3: My Own Flourish Data Visualization 

The image below is a slope chart looking at how G7 member countries' Debt-to-GDP ratios compare to the OECD average from 2009 to now. Although G7 data is available for the entire time period in the dataset, the OECD average is only available from 2009 to the present. This is why the the graphic focuses on that time period. All G7 countries, with the exception of Germany, have a higher Debt-to-GDP ratio than the OECD average for the entire time period. The graphic is interactive and the information for all other OECD countries can be found by hovering over any of the unhighlighted lines. 

Without presenting the data in another chart of graphics like above, the data needed to be grouped in some way. I initially wanted to just do a simple line graph, but could not figure out how to highlight groups on Flourish. This led me to the Slope Chart, which allows me to highlight groups (while still visualizing the remaining data) and show change over time like a line graph. To get the data to fit the Flourish template for a Slope Chart, I had to transpose the data and format it the right way. I also had to remove certain years from the dataset. At first, I looked at data from 1995 - 2021, but realized that I could only look at the G7 countries without comparing to the average. I removed 1995 - 2008 and then visualized the graphic from 2009 - 2021 with every year included. That felt too much like a line graph, so I included only the years 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2021 in the final graphic to show change over time periods, not just change over time. If this was a static graphic, I only would have included the G7 countries and the OECD average. In a static image, the other OECD countries that are not highlighted would add far too much clutter to the graphic. Since the Flourish slope chart is dynamic, I included all the non-highlighted other OECD countries in the background because a viewer can easily explore those countries as well and compare them to the OECD average or G7 countries. The non-highlighted countries are not the focus of this graphic but can become the focus if a viewer is interested in that. As long as a OECD country has Debt-to-GDP ratio data in every year from 2009 – 2021, they are included in this graphic. 

In addition to transposing the data, I also added groups in Flourish to make coloring the graphic easier. The six G7 countries that are consistently above the OECD average from 2009 – 2021 are in the ‘G7+’ group. Germany, the one G7 country that is currently below the OECD average, is in the ‘G7-‘ group. Lastly, the OECD average row is in the ‘Avg’ group. These groupings allowed me to make custom highlights. The ‘G7-‘ group is green because it can be considered good to be below the OECD average ratio. The ‘G7+’ group is red because it can be considered bad to be above the OECD average. The ‘Avg’ group is highlighted black because black makes it stick out in comparison to the other two groups and it also prevents the line from fading into the background (like it would if it was a grey line). 

The Flourish default for the axis was the top of the page. I thought that would add too much clutter to the chart and might get overlooked if it is so close to the title. It also just makes more conventional sense to have the time periods at the bottom. 

As it relates to labels, having the country labels on both sides of the chart make each line clearer and limit confusion as to what each line is referring to. The connector lines are necessary because of how close some ratios are. Adding any more spacing would make the connector lines more complicated (and bigger) and add clutter. 
I think the title and sub-title in this graphic point to ideas of the chart. I had difficulty deciding if Debt-to-GDP ratios or G7 countries should go first in the title. Leading with both hopefully makes it clear that the focus of this chart is Debt-to-GDP ratios in G7 countries as they compare to the OECD average. Since the main title uses ‘mostly’ I thought it was important for the sub-header to explicitly mention the exception among G7 countries (i.e. Germany).

## Comparing All the Visuals

The data on this page all comes from the OECD website and is OECD member country Debt-to-GDP ratios from 1995 - 2021 (or the most recent year available. Each graphic looks at OECD member country Debt-to-GDP ratios at different times or in different time periods. The first graphic looks at the ratio in 2021 or the most recent year where data is available. The second graphic looks at the ratio for all years that data is available. The last graphic looks at the data in time five time periods and only includes countries that have data in all five time periods. Each graphic is interactive and presents a viewer with more information than if they were static images. The dynamic ability was influential in picking a slope chart for the third visual. Unlike the other two visuals, the slope chart clearly groups the data and looks at change between time periods. The chart of line graphs looks at change over time, but not in groups and not as clearly as in the slope chart. Even though the data is grouped, a viewer can clearly look at data for any other OECD with data from 2009 – 2021. The chart has an emphasis, but a viewer can also explore the overall dataset more in the third graphic.

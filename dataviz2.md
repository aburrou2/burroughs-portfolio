# Visualizing Government Debt

## Image 1: A Web-Based Data Visualization

The image below is a web-based image from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. The image contains all OECD countries reporting their Debt-to-GDP ratio in the most recent reporting year. All countries are the same color because the intention is for no country to stick out. An additional purpose of making each bar the same color is to allow the viewer to make any comparisons they want to. The graphic in its current state does not emphasize any comparisons aside from comparing any country or countries to the OECD average. One more note on the clarity of this graphic. The ascending left-right sort makes the contrast between the countries with the lowest and highest debt-to-GDP ratios clear.

## Image 2: Flourish Grid of Line Charts

Below is a graphic from the Tool Flourish that uses the same data as  Image 1. The time period for this graphic spans from 1995 - 2021. Data for each country is presented when available and not every country is shown for the entire time period. The image below looks at time completely differently than Image 1. One key observation with the image below is that Debt-to-GDP ratio varies throughout the world. It is not just countries on one continent that have high (or low) Debt-to-GDP ratios. There is a lot going on in this graphic which is why the title is simple. The varying ratios are the most apparent initial observation. Because of this, I made them the focus of the title. Drawing attention to specific countries or regions would require too much thinking/searching for a viewer. 

The default color for this graphic was blue. I thought that was too 'cool' of a color and did not match the topic. Debt-to-GDP ratios are not an inherently cool or neutral idea and can be quite bad for world governments. Because of this, I wanted to choose a more neutral color that is not associated with coolness. I initially used purple, but decided on yellow since yellow is a neutral color between red and green. Some Debt-to-GDP ratios could be depicted with red (if they are bad) and green (if they are good) but since this graphic shows all the ratios together, a neutral color like yellow makes sense based on its neutral connotation. 

Another idea I went back and forth on for awhile was if I should include grid lines. I took them out, but I thought that taking them out would make it too difficult for the viewer to make comparisons or look at individual countries. The gridlines seem to point a viewer in the direction of where the comparison time period begins and ends for a country and at what ratio value it begins at as well. 

I did not include axis labels in this graphic because I think it is obvious what they mean. Adding them would contribute clutter to the graphic in a format like this. I also think that the title, which references the Debt-to-GDP ratios and time period, emphasizes that the axes will refer to ratio and time information. I also made sure that the country abbreviations aligned with the Y-axis. I initially changed the country abbreviations to be centered. However, alignment is important and contributes to clarity so I changed them to be left-aligned. 

Two things I wish I could have done differntly, but could not figure out how to do on Flourish pertain to both axes. I would have liked to change the Y-axis (the Debt-to-GDP ratio value) to have a more incrementally even scale. I think an increment of 50 or even 100 would have been suffice. Both would be less confusing than what is currently presented. As for the X-axis, I wish that the year labels started at the first year in the data set (1995) and ended with the last year (2021). These changes would enhance the clarity of the time period in the graphic. The title does indicate a longer comparison period than is shown in the X-axis, but the title and axis label should have better agreement.

## Image 3: My Own Flourish Data Visualization 

The image below is a slope chart looking at how G7 member countries' Debt-to-GDP ratios compare to the OECD average from 2009 to now. Although G7 data is available for the entire time period in the dataset, the OECD average is only available from 2009 to the present. This is why the the graphic focuses on that time period. All G7 countries, with the exception of Germany, have a higher Debt-to-GDP ratio than the OECD average for the entire time period. The graphic is interactive and the information for all other OECD countries can be found by hovering over any of the unhighlighted lines.

# Visualizing Government Debt

## Image 1: A Web-Based Data Visualization

The image below is a web-based image from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website.

## Image 2: Flourish Data Visualization 1

Below is a graphic from the Tool Flourish that uses the same data as in Image 1. The time period for this graphic spans from 1995 - 2021. Data for each country is presented when available and not every country is shown for the entire time period. The image below looks at time completely differently than Image 1. One key observation with the image below is that Debt-to-GDP ratio varies throughout the world. It is not just countries on one continent that have high (or low) Debt-to-GDP ratios.

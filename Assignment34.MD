# Assignment 3&4 Write Up

## Original Image

The image I am redesigned in this assignment is located below. It is part of [this](https://www.publicsource.org/pps-enrollment-decline-pittsburgh-public-school-building-closures/) article from Public Source. I chose this image because education policy is a field of interest for me and I appreciate the work that Public Source does reporting on issues in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Additionally, I selected this visual because the story it tells is a powerful and important story. The story this information can tell is important, but the current graphic does not do a great job at telling the story in the most captivating way. I thought that many changes could be made to the image to make it more intuitive, captivating, aesthetically pleasing, and more useful for its audience. An effective graphic on this particular story (Pittsburgh Public Schools enrollment) should inspire viewers. The goal of my redesign was to present viewers with a useful, intuitive, and captivating graphic that conveys the seriousness of the issue and inspires audience members to engage with the issue and do something about it. This issue is important to me and should be to others, but the current graphic does not convey the importance of the information in an inspiring way.

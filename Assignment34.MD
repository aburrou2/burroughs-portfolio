# Assignment 3&4 Write Up

This assignment focused on redesigning an image found online. The main steps in this assignment were finding the original image, critiquing the original image, wireframing a solution, testing the solution, building the solution, retesting the solution, and making a final build of the solution. I talk about each step in the process on this page. 

## Original Image

The image I am redesigned in this assignment is located below. It is part of [this](https://www.publicsource.org/pps-enrollment-decline-pittsburgh-public-school-building-closures/) article from Public Source. I chose this image because education policy is a field of interest for me and I appreciate the work that Public Source does reporting on issues in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Additionally, I selected this visual because the story it tells is a powerful and important story. The story this information can tell is important, but the current graphic does not do a great job at telling the story in the most captivating way. I thought that many changes could be made to the image to make it more intuitive, captivating, aesthetically pleasing, and more useful for its audience. An effective graphic on this particular story (Pittsburgh Public Schools enrollment) should inspire viewers. The goal of my redesign was to present viewers with a useful, intuitive, and captivating graphic that conveys the seriousness of the issue and inspires audience members to engage with the issue and do something about it. This issue is important to me and should be to others, but the current graphic does not convey the importance of the information in an inspiring way.

## The Redesign Process

### Critiquing The Original Image

Critiquing the original image was the first step in the redesign process. The critique method used for this assignment can be found [here](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf). This method reminded me that information in any graphic not only needs to be clear, but also useful for its intended audience. Understandable, intuitive information is just one aspect of an effective data visualization. It is crucial for any effective data visualization to communicate why the information it contains is useful. As it relates to redesigning the original graphic, this encouraged me to focus on the title and subtitle as ways to make the information more useful. Similarly, this critique method made me really think about who the intended audience was for this graphic. With them in mind, I could create a more effective graphic. I had Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS) parents or potential PPS parents in mind when doing my redesign. 

Overall, the critique method helped me to identify the main aspects I wanted to change when redesigning the graphic. The graph needs more context as to why the information is useful and important. This could come from a better title and subtitle that point to an idea, not just the structure of the graphic. Additionally, the chart could use a better distinction between actual and projected data as the gap between the two lines in the original is awkward and unintuitive. The color scheme could also be improved and simplified to increase the attractiveness of the chart. Lastly, there is too much clutter because of the gridlines, axis values, and amount of text. These are all things I tried to improve in the redesign.  

### Wireframing a Solution

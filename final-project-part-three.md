# The final data story

[Here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/declining-wic-participation-in-southwestern-pennsylvania/index.html#section-lGOEzMoZrn) is the published link to my final data story on Shorthand. I made significant changes to it that I will talk about more in the section below. I made a copy of what I turned in for Part 2 and made the changes in that new copy. I did that so I could easily compare the final product to the intermediate product and see the changes, growth, and how my thought process changed from one step to the next. 

# Changes made since Part II
The biggest changes I made to involved fleshing out the story more. I added more context throughout the story. The feedback I received made it clear that more context was needed throughout the story. It felt too much like a PowerPoint and not enough like a story. I also think that adding more text increased the presentationâ€™s ability to stand on its own since most people looking at the story will not realistically see the final presentation. Additionally, the class audience did not see the whole story. It was important to add more context and flesh out the story more so if any of them were interested they could view my whole story and learn more. The goal of adding to my story was to include as much relevant information as possible so that someone curious about WIC would not need to go elsewhere to learn about the program. I also think that adding context helps lead my audience to the call to action. By adding more to the overall story, everything hopefully flows together better and the call to action is a more logical and natural ending point than before. 

Another big change I made was leading with the problem. I wanted the problem I was trying to solve be obvious at the start. I tried to do this by changing the title and making it allude more to the problem (declining WIC participation in the area). I also tried to reinforce the problem at the beginning by mentioning the problem again when I defined WIC, SW, and PA. Defining WIC, SW, and PA early were important since they are common abbreviations throughout the story and a misunderstanding on those abbreviations would be distracting to the story. 

In terms of specific context I added, I added more text at the beginning that explains who is eligible for WIC, how long they are eligible, and what makes someone eligible for WIC. Since my intended audience is people who know local mothers, infants, and/or children or may become a parent in the area in the future, it is important that they come away with knowledge on who is eligible for WIC. 

I also added more context around the charts. For each of the series of graphs, I wrote about some observations. I did this because I wanted the main takeaways to be obvious and I wanted the text to reinforce the main takeaways that are hopefully obvious from looking at the charts. 

It was apparent in my user research that people did not come away from my story thinking that funding being tied to participation was troublesome. I wanted that to be a main takeaway. I also think that point is crucial to my story, and wanted people to feel a sense of urgency because of that point. To make it more obvious, I improved the graphic with downward arrows and added more text next to the image to explain why exactly funding being tied to participation is troublesome. Building this out was important for the story to stand on its own and still have the main points obvious to someone viewing the story without me presenting it to them. 

Lastly, I added more context around the three components I think can increase WIC participation. I wanted audience members to know more about these components so that they would have less questions about what these services offer. Additionally, before talking about the three resources that people know less about, I thought it was important to briefly talk about the food packages that WIC offers participants. People usually know about the food aspect of WIC benefits, but it is still important to mention them if someone in the audience is brand new to learning about WIC. This whole section of the presentation builds off the earlier context that talks about who is eligible for WIC and how long they are eligible for. This section details how WIC supports families. I think adding this context here ties the story together. People should now know about who is eligible for WIC and what WIC offers to eligible individuals. That is all important information for this story and the story is more complete because it includes this information. 


## The audience

I still had the same audience in mind for the final story as I did in Part 2. The first is residents of Southwestern Pennsylvania, particularly people who know local mothers, infants, and/or children or may become a parent in the area in the future (i.e. people who live in Southwestern Pennsylvania that know mothers, infants, or children that could benefit from WIC). The second audience is policymakers who have a broader and more general reason to care about the issue. 

All the changes I made were with the audience in mind. I kept both the audience in the classroom in mind and an audience who would view my story without me presenting it to them. It was because of them that I made my call to action stronger and more actionable. Not only did I encourage the audience of people who know local mothers, infants, and/or children or may become a parent in the area in the future to spread awareness of WIC, but I also provided them with resources to find out more about the program or locate a nearby WIC clinic. I wanted the audience to come away with more information on WIC and to have resources as well. Before they just had information, but now I feel like they have resources and actionable things they can do to increase participation in the area (aside from spreading awareness). They also have easier access to resources that could personally help them or people they know. Coming into Part 3, I had a clear audience, but I needed to cater my presentation more to that audience. I did that by adding more context and making a more actionable call to action. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

All the pictures used in the presentation are free, non-copyrighted images. Other graphics were created by me, and the information used to create those images is cited in the published story. 

The only additional comment I would like to add here pertains to the data cleaning I did for the section where I talked about 41% and 59% of eligible individuals. I got these numbers from five separate county reports and then entered them into a spreadsheet where I did aggregate calculations. The rest of my data in this presentation was cleaned by simply removing rows that did not contain information on Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington, or Westmoreland County.

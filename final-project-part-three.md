# The final data story

[Here](https://preview.shorthand.com/D6MsXnT6LCc4VDuC) is the link to my final data story on Shorthand. I made significant changes to it that I will talk about more in the section below. I made a copy of what I turned in for Part 2 and made the changes in that new copy. I did that so I could easily compare the final product to the intermediate product and see the changes, growth, and how my thought process changed from one step to the next. 

# Changes made since Part II

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

# The final data story

[Here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/declining-wic-participation-in-southwestern-pennsylvania/index.html#section-lGOEzMoZrn) is the published link to my final data story on Shorthand. I made significant changes to it that I will talk about more in the section below. I made a copy of what I turned in for Part 2 and made the changes in that new copy. I did that so I could easily compare the final product to the intermediate product and see the changes, growth, and how my thought process changed from one step to the next. 

# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

## References

My references for this project can be found at the bottom of Shorthand story which again is linked [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/declining-wic-participation-in-southwestern-pennsylvania/index.html#group-section-TjwLB9wlDx). All the pictures used in the presentation are free, non-copyrighted images. Other graphics were created by me, and the information used to create those images is cited in the published story. 

The only additional comment I would like to add here pertains to the data cleaning I did for the section where I talked about 41% and 59% of eligible individuals. I got these numbers from five separate county reports and then entered them into a spreadsheet where I did aggregate calculations. The rest of my data in this presentation was cleaned by simply removing rows that did not contain information on Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington, or Westmoreland County. 


# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
